Deployment Of ML Application In Azure Cloud Using Github Actions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
Azure Account: You need an Azure account. If you don't have one, you can create a free account at Azure Portal.

GitHub Repository: Your ML application code should be hosted on GitHub.

Azure Machine Learning Service: Set up Azure Machine Learning service. You can create a workspace from the Azure Portal.

Azure CLI: Install Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from here.

Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your local machine.

Steps:
1. Set Up Azure Machine Learning Environment:
Open your Azure Portal.
Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace.
Retrieve the workspace details like subscription ID, resource group, and workspace name.
2. Add Azure Credentials to GitHub Repository:
In your GitHub repository, go to Settings.
Navigate to Secrets > New Repository Secret.
Add Azure credentials such as AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP, AZURE_WORKSPACE_NAME, AZURE_MACHINELEARNING_KEY (you can find this key in your Azure Machine Learning Workspace).
3. Configure GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a .github/workflows/azure-ml-deploy.yml file in your repository with the following content:

yaml
Copy code
name: Azure ML Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t your-docker-image-name .

      - name: Push Docker Image to Azure Container Registry
        run: |
          az acr login --name your-acr-name
          docker tag your-docker-image-name your-acr-name.azurecr.io/your-docker-image-name:latest
          docker push your-acr-name.azurecr.io/your-docker-image-name:latest

      - name: Deploy to Azure ML
        run: |
          az ml model deploy -n your-deployment-name --image your-acr-name.azurecr.io/your-docker-image-name:latest --cpu 1 --memory 1 -f your-inference-config-file.yml
Replace placeholders like your-docker-image-name, your-acr-name, your-deployment-name, and your-inference-config-file.yml with your actual values.

4. Commit and Push:
Commit the changes to your repository and push them to the main branch.

5. Monitor Deployment:
Go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the deployment workflow. If everything is set up correctly, your ML application will be deployed to Azure whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
